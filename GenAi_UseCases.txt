# Identifying UCs:

## Code Generation

- Code completion an debugging using GitHub Copilot assistant or so on.

- Gen RAG AI code synthesis proposing ready to use similar internal software blocs or code.

- GenUI for code synthesis with a predifined structured prompt and scrutiny quality-loop (N-Shot).


## Code Quality:

- Duplicate Code Detection:Identifying repeated source code fragments within a codebase to maintain code quality.

- Code Smell Identification:Identifies problematic patterns in code structure and design that may indicate a deeper issue, unlike other refactoring techniques.

- Bottleneck Identification:Identifying the specific step or component in a process that limits the overall productivity

- Automated review:Automated code review process without human involvement.
